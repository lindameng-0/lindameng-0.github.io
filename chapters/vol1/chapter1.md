Eli stood in silence, his eyes tracing the glint of the city’s architecture as though trying to memorize the very pulse of it. Everything glimmered like a dream—a dream that had always seemed just a little too perfect to touch, yet somehow, here it was, real and tangible. A home at last, where every corner promised safety, where every stone had been laid with the best intentions. After all, it had been born of their ideals, as delicate and fleeting as the first rays of sunlight that caressed the ground at dawn. They had called it Singularity, this world of their own design, where everything was meant to be perfect. And Eli had been the one who believed in it all, who truly thought that in this virtual world, they could finally right the wrongs of the world outside. Theretruely was beauty in this place, a beauty that spoke in silence, in the way the light moved, in the way the air tasted when one inhaled, in the way the people had smiled for the first time in years.

He had been one of those people once.

He didn’t know how he found himself on the streets of Singularity’s headquarters. It was all a blur, wandering through the streets like a ghost. It wasn’t prosperous back then, in fact, it could barely be called a city. But it was enough, far more than enough. He knew that as soon as he caught the first glimpse of those gates. 

They were nothing like the gates of the outside world, those glowing lines and artificial barriers. These gates were grand, almost impossibly so, rising up from the ground as though they had always been there—waiting for him. Tall, golden, and gleaming in the light. He could remember the moment like it was yesterday, how he had stood before them, unsure whether they were real, whether they were just another illusion his broken mind had conjured in an attempt to escape.

He had been staring at them for what felt like hours when a voice had broken through the silence.

"Are you lost?" 

There had been no hesitation, no suspicion in Nox’s eyes when she saw Eli, staring at the gates as if they were an insurmountable wall. And so the gates had opened, slow and steady, for a complete stranger. Nox and Rae had welcomed him, as if it had been his destiny all along, as if Eli had always belonged here.

All he could muster was a quiet “Why?” 

"You’re like us." Nox had said to him, leaning against a pillar, arms crossed. "You’ve got that look. The kind people get when they’re lost, or they’ve just left something behind." Her words were blunt, but there was no malice. 

Eli hadn’t answered at first. What could he say? He *was* lost, wasn’t he? Lost in this strange, new place, where everything felt like a second chance, even though he hadn’t been sure he even deserved one.

“I think this place could save you,” Rae had said. “If you let it.”

And Eli had believed in them.

He had believed that they could create something beautiful together, a perfect world that could rise from the ashes of everything they had lost in the world outside. He had believed that this was where the broken could be made whole again, where no one had to suffer, and where no one would ever be left behind.

The new world was theirs, it seemed. All they had to do was reach out and take it.

But that was before Valkyria took a part of it away, one piece at a time. 

Valkyria had never been aligned with Singularity. Quite the opposite, really. Their class already decided that their goal would be irreconcilable with Singularity’s—after all, it was perfectly reasonable for them to want to return to the real world, even if it meant destroying this one. The outside world was their home, a place they had never quite understood the lives of those who lived outside the glowing city penthouses. 

It wasn’t always like this, not until Valkyria started getting impatient, violent even, as Singularity grew more influential. So their fragile, silent peace was shattered when Valkyria began infiltrating their ranks, sending spies and wanting to consume singularity from the inside out. It was too easy for them, because back then the walls around Singularity were too low, the gate too open. Although there were only a few spies in the end, it was enough to make them become careful, all of them, stepping lightly over cracks in the floor that no one dared mention. 

It was Nox who had made the final decision. It had been her voice that had declared the outside world too dangerous. 

The gates were shut now, locked from the inside. And in the shadow of fear, Eli somehow found himself to be the one holding the key.

Rae had protested, of course. She had argued that Eli was not the one for this task. He had never been made for this kind of decision, she had said.

But Nox had insisted. And in the end, Eli had been the one to take the mantle. 

Executor. Judge. Executioner.

In the silence that followed, Eli could still hear the faint echoes of the words in his head. It is for the greater good.

But was it? Was it really? Eli hated it. He hated the way his hands shook when he signed the orders. He hated the way his mind screamed in revolt when he put on the bloodied gloves. He hated that this was the only way he could protect the people who still believed in Singularity, the only way to save them from the threats they couldn’t see. He had told himself that they had to be punished, that the future of the city depended on it, but the faces of the traitors—their wide, pleading eyes—haunted him still. Rae had been right. This was not who he was. This was not who he had ever wanted to be.

With or without the gloves, the blood had a way to become stains, the kind that clung to you without your consent, until it became a part of your skin. How long had it been since his hands were clean? Since the world had been clean? Months, maybe—more? He wasn’t sure anymore. Time had lost meaning when every decision bled into the next, when every face blurred together in the dim light.

Tonight, the knocking came again. He was not surprised. He never was anymore.

It was a sound unpleasant to the ear, a sharp rhythm that sounded too much like an accusation. Like a judgment Eli hadn’t yet agreed to pass.

“Your Honor, are you there?” The voice came through the door. 

Eli could hear the weight of someone’s breath on the other side, waiting.

He turned, the chair creaking under him, and for a moment, he considered pretending not to hear. Let them wait. Let the world outside his little corner wait.

But the door swung open anyway. 

At the threshold stood two lines of soldiers, with a person caught between them. It was difficult to see him through the looming soldiers, but judging by his stature he could probably pass as a “young man” the same age as Eli, maybe a little older, a little younger. 

One of the soldiers spoke in quick, clipped sentences, something about one of the vaults, something about a stolen file. But Eli barely listened. Their words had no meaning beyond the immediate. They would tell him what they had brought, of course, but the real question had already been asked in the silence of the room.

“What’s the punishment?”

Eli didn't need to look at them to know that they were waiting for his answer. They always did. It was expected, like the air in his lungs, like the weight of the title that clung to him like a second skin. They had all come to depend on him. On his decisions. On his judgments.

And in that moment, Eli knew he could not turn away.

He could not stop.

He did not know if he was saving anyone anymore.

But he knew he had to make the choice. The young man’s fate, like all the others before him, would be decided in this room. And the consequences of that decision would be far-reaching, far beyond the walls of Singularity, far beyond the ghosts of those they had betrayed. It was a truth that Eli had known all along: sometimes, the hardest choices were the ones that were already made.

This was the world they had created. And this was the price of it.

"The punishment," Eli whispered, his voice a brittle thing, "is death."

Eli found himself standing in darkness, a void so complete that it felt as though the universe had exhaled its final breath and forgotten to inhale again. He had never encountered such nothingness before—no light, no sound, not even the faintest tremor of air. The weight of silence pressed in from all sides, suffocating. His hands, held before him, were no more than vague suggestions of existence. He couldn’t see them. Couldn’t feel them. He wondered, for a moment, if he was still breathing, if he was still there. If there was even a place to be.

Time, too, seemed to stretch and collapse like a breath held too long. He waited, longer than he should have, his pulse thudding in his ears as his eyes adjusted slowly—infinitesimally—to the oppressive dark. 

And then, it appeared.

A figure, standing still, its back turned to him. At first, Eli thought it might have been a trick of his eyes, but then he realized—

It was a young man.

*That* young man.

Eli moved toward him instinctively. Each step was careful, as if treading on broken glass, hesitant yet drawn to the figure in the distance. Closer now, so close he could almost reach out and touch him. Just one more step, and—

There it was.

Glass.

Cold, hard, glass—it was there, pressing against his palms. Transparent, yet solid. Something invisible and unyielding, as though it had materialized from the void just to stop him. 

He tried to push it away. Willed it to vanish.

But no matter how hard he tried, the glass remained as cold and immovable as the darkness itself. A wall, invisible and yet so very real, one he couldn’t control just like the darkness. It was there, though he couldn’t understand why it should be. 

So he raised his hand, ready to strike it, to break it with the force of his desperation to reach what’s just beyond it. And just as he moved, just as he pulled his fist back—

The young man turned.

And Eli froze, every fiber of his being locked in place as their gazes met.

His eyes—were they eyes at all?

Before Eli knew it, the young man’s gaze was stripping the world away, piece by piece. Then it all fell away. 

Then, as if he had been pulled from some distant place, Eli opened his eyes with a gasp, as though the air itself had returned to his lungs. 

His hands were there—still his hands, still warm—and he could hear his own breathing.

But the young man was there too.

 His gaze darted around, frantic at first, until his surroundings began to coalesce into something familiar. The judgment room.

The young man was sitting across from him.

But not the same. No. This time, he was real. Flesh and blood, but inert. His black hair hung in a heavy veil, obscuring his face. The emptiness was still there, like a cold, gnawing presence beneath the surface, lurking, patient. Eli, heart still pounding in his chest, could feel the weight of that emptiness pressing down on him. He didn’t speak. He couldn’t. It felt like words were far too fragile to exist in the presence of this.

The young man’s voice cut through the silence with a flatness that felt like a knife scraping against stone.

When Eli opened his eyes, the first thing he noticed was the dim light. 

Eli awoke with a start, gasping for air as though he had been submerged in a deep, cold sea. His surroundings were dim now, the soft, familiar glow of the judgment room surrounding him. The oppressive weight of the void had lifted, but the coldness lingered, a phantom touch still tracing the edges of his thoughts. He was back. But not quite.

He blinked rapidly, trying to recalibrate himself. It was as though the world had shifted in ways that made no sense, a twisting of space and time that left him disoriented, unsettled. But this was not new for him, was it? He was used to the strange realms between dreams and waking. He had been tasked with such responsibilities for years now.

But this, this, was different.

He looked up slowly, and there, across from him, sat the young man. His black hair spilled over his face like ink, the strands forming a curtain between Eli and the young man’s eyes. The stillness of the room was oppressive, but it was a stillness that Eli had come to know in his years as a Justice of Singularity. Yet today, it felt heavier, as if the air itself had thickened and slowed, the silence becoming a tangible weight that pressed on his chest.

For a moment, neither moved. Neither spoke.

The air was sharp, cool. There was light now—faint, but enough to make out his surroundings. He was back in the judgment room. 

He sat like a statue, unmoving, silent. As if waiting. Waiting for something that didn’t matter anymore.

The air was cool, but not suffocating. It felt… real. He could breathe again. He was back. The judgment room. His hands were visible now, resting on the cold stone surface before him. The dim light above cast long shadows that made the room feel more oppressive, yet the tension from the darkness was gone.

But the young man was still there. Across from him. Sitting. His head hung low, black hair spilling over his face like a veil. Silence. Unbroken, unsettling silence.

For a moment, Eli simply sat there. Silent. His heart still racing from the aftershock of the dream—or whatever it had been. He couldn't quite distinguish dream from reality anymore. He couldn’t fathom what that had been, or why his body still trembled with a sense of unease. The young man hadn’t moved since Eli's awakening. He remained motionless, like a statue carved out of stone. And for a moment, Eli just... watched him. His hands clenched, his fingers curling into fists as he tried to steady his breathing.

And yet—

“Do you enjoy prying into other people’s dreams?”

The young man, without lifting his gaze, spoke.

Eli didn’t flinch, though there was a catch in his throat. He had never expected to hear those words, not like this. From anyone. Let alone someone like this.

“No,” Eli replied softly, almost reflexively. 

Eyes, they say, are windows to the soul.

His eyes were not eyes at all.

Empty. Black.

Pits.

Eli’s breath caught in his throat. There was nothing there—nothing human, nothing familiar. No soul behind those eyes, no recognition. Just darkness, like holes gouged into the very fabric of existence. They were the kind of eyes that belonged to a place where nothing existed, not even light. 

And yet, Eli couldn’t look away.
