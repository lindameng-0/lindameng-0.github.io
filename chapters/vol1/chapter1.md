## Prologue

It was the rain that defined those first days after the Cataclysm.

Not the brilliance of the sky shattering, not the great roaring as the earth opened to swallow entire villages. Not even the crystals that fell like stars, trailing fire and ash in their wake. All of those moments burned into memory, certainly—but it was the rain that lingered. It came after the light and fire had gone, after the screams had faded to silence. A rain that seemed endless, like the world itself had turned to water, washing away what little remained.

It was the kind of rain that numbed the world. It seeped into the ground and the cracks of buildings, into the bones of the living and the silence of the dead. It fell relentlessly, pooling in cracks and craters, carving rivers where none had flowed before. The rain had been falling for seven days, and the earth beneath it had forgotten what it meant to breathe without drowning.

This was what the world had become. He had seen it from the moment the skies shattered.

Somewhere beneath it all, Eli walked. He could not remember the last time he had felt dry, or warm, or anything other than this bone-deep ache that made his legs feel like lead with every step. Somewhere far behind him, the rest of the patrol lingered—if they even still moved. He hadn’t looked back in hours. 

 

The rain hammered down harder as he turned the corner into what had once been a bustling path. There was nothing left now. The shacks of the slums were too weak, both for the fire that came before and the rain that came after. He didn’t look at them too long. There were faces, sometimes. Shadows that caught the corner of his eye, people that weren’t there when he turned. He told himself they weren’t there.

They really weren’t there.

There were no concepts of ghosts here, or any remnants of the dead. Only nothingness was left behind when people turned into ash. 

Yet, he walked. He walked because there might still be someone left to find, and if he stopped, he would think.

Then he saw him.

At first, Eli thought he was part of the rubble. Draped in a ragged black cloak that clung to his frame, the young man sat unmoving on the broken steps of what might have been a house, or a shop, or something else entirely. His head was bowed, the rain tracing rivers down his black hair, across his face, falling at his feet. He didn’t move, didn’t flinch, didn’t even shiver despite the biting cold. 

Eli’s breath caught. For a moment, he thought the young man might already be dead. But no—there was a rise and fall to his chest, faint but steady. Still alive. Still here.

“Are you all right?” Eli’s quiet voice broke against the rain, his words drowned before they could reach anywhere at all.

The young man did not answer. He sat unmoving as if the world had already buried him.

“Let’s go,” Eli said gently. Eli reached out, his hand trembling in the cold, but stopped short of touching the young man’s shoulder. “Please.”

The young man’s eyes finally moved then, locking onto Eli’s with a force that made him freeze. 

Eli had seen fear before. He had seen grief, rage, hopelessness, and every shade of misery that followed in the wake of the disaster. But he had never seen eyes like this—eyes so hollow they might have been carved from glass, reflecting nothing but the rain that fell between them. Eyes that seemed to have already seen the end of the world and found it wanting. He wasn’t trembling. He wasn’t afraid.

He was waiting.

The boy didn’t blink, didn’t stir, and Eli felt a flare of something sharp and raw twist in his chest. Anger, maybe, or desperation. How could he just sit there? How could he let the rain swallow him whole? Eli couldn’t just leave him. Not like this.

“Everything going to be okay,” Eli smiled faintly. “I promise.”

He raised his hand, and everything around them quieted.

Light. It spilled from his hands like a blooming flower, soft and blue, casting a gentle glow that pushed back the shadows. It rose and expanded to a dome of radiance that caught each falling droplet and suspended it mid-air, turning the rain into a cascade of shimmering jewels. 

For a moment, the world felt… still. Not broken. Not bleeding. Just still.

The young man looked up.

“Why?” the young man’s voice was barely more than silence it broke.

Eli didn’t answer immediately. He didn’t have an answer—not one that would mean anything, not one that wasn’t a lie. Everything was gone. *Everyone *was gone. 

*Why?*

“Because,” He said at last, “You’re still here.”

For the first time, the young man blinked. 

Eli wanted to stay longer. He wanted to coax the young man out of his silence, to promise him safety, to prove that even in a world so broken, there could still be something worth saving, a new *something *that could rise from the ashes. But there were others out there—others who needed him. He couldn’t stay.

“I’ll be back,” Eli promised, stepping out from under the dome. The rain immediately soaked through his coat, but he didn’t care. “Wait for me.”

The young man didn’t answer.

When he returned hours later, the young man was gone.

The rain stopped on the eighth day.

And where the boy had been, a single flower grew, its white petals gleaming like the light of a distant star underneath the barrier. 

Eli stood alone in the quiet after the storm, staring down at the fragile bloom.

*It was enough. For now.*

However, the light born here would not remain contained. It would unfurl like the first breath of spring, spilling beyond this broken place.

Years later, it would become the city that would be known as *Auralis.*
